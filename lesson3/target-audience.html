        <p> The target audience for my chamber of commerce website will be the citizens of Rexburg and all those looking to have Rexburg be their home for a significant part of their lives.</p>
        <p>One of the many citizens that call rexburg their home is the Rexburg Idaho students that come from all over the world. People like Hanna will come asking questions about how much local fun can be fun in the city and how they can have a safe and fun time around the city.</p>

        <p>The most important audience will be the local families with bussiness and local carrers. The aim is to help them trust their city to be a safe and fun place to raise their families and stay after they raise their families. 
            A family like Johns wil be coming with questions like what the city is doing to improve schools and keep families safe from COVID-19.
